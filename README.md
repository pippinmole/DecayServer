## How to set up a server
1. Locate the server files (for now, they are located in [RootGameDir]/server/).
2. Open the 'Run Server.bat' and change the configuration to your liking.
3. Run the bat file, and wait for the server to start.

## Current workarounds
If you select anywhere inside the console window, it will pause the server. It is a known issue and I am looking for a fix for this.
